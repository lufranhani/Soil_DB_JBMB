Repository of results obtained by soil analysis in Bauru Botanical Garden, SP, Brazil. 
Variables considered on this study: 
Sand, Silt and Clay proportions according to Bouyoucos Method (g kg-1). 
Borum (B), Cooper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Zincum (Zn), Phosphorous (P), Sulfur (S), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K), Aluminum (Al), Nitrogen (N), Nitrogen Stable Isotope (N15), Carbon (C), Carbon Stabel Isotope (C13), Correlation of C divided by N (C/N), Potencial Acidity (H+Al), Sum of Bases (SB), Cation Exchange Capacity (CTC)), Latitude (Coord_X), Longitude (Coord_Y), Altitude (Coord_Z), Bulk Density (BD), Carbon Stocks (Cstock). 

For the entire database found in this repositorie:
SSF = Semideciduous Seasonal Forest; 
DWS = Densely Woodded Savanna; 
DA = Deforested Area.

Sheet 1 "df" = Cstock_Total refer to the total Soil Organic Carbon Stock found as considering the entire soil profile measured (0 - 100 cm), for everyone of the 30 sampling points.

Sheet 2 "df1" = Analysis performed on the soil that correspond for the 0 - 20 cm soil layer. 
Sheet 3 "df2" = Analysis performed on the soil that correspond for the 20 - 40 cm soil layer. 
Sheet 4 "df3" = Analysis performed on the soil that correspond for the 40 - 60 cm soil layer. 
Sheet 5 "df4" = Analysis performed on the soil that correspond for the 60 - 80 cm soil layer. 
Sheet 6 "df5" = Analysis performed on the soil that correspond for the 80 - 100 cm soil layer. 
Sheet 7 "Plot" = Refer to the dataset used to create the boxplot for visualization of the results found when comparing treatments and soil depths.
